# RamHacks2021
Submission for RamHacks2021: team CarMax Workshop

## Inspiration
Presented with the challenge of allowing customers to view vehicles that are currently in transfer or require light reconditioning, our focus was on creating the most user friendly interface given CarMax’s pre-existing website. We followed similar page formats and added engaging elements from an in-depth progress bar and watch list, to a page exclusively for vehicles undergoing reconditioning.


## What it does
Our project is about giving CarMax customers the advantage of looking at vehicles while they are being reconditioned. It can provide the customers more options in addition to the cars that are ready to be sold, and plan early to buy a vehicle. Customers also become a part of its journey by joining the watchlist where they will be updated on the car’s progress.

Customers also have the opportunity to reserve a car while it is being reconditioned by clicking on the ‘RESERVE’ button. This button would take the user to another webpage where they can input their credentials and reserve the vehicle for a small fee.
